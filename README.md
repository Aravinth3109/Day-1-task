Q.No:1> Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP/1.1 being the most widely used version of the protocol. However, with the increasing demand for faster and more efficient web applications, HTTP/2 was introduced.
HTTP/2 is more efficiency and speed compare to HTTP/1.1.(example:HTTP/2 has the latest technology like Multiplexing, Header Compression, Server Push, Binary Protocol in these departments the HTTP/2 has more advantage to use.)
In multiplex HTTP/1.1 uses a single connection to transfer a single file at a time. On the other hand the HTTP/2, uses a technique called multiplexing, where multiple requests can be sent and received on the same connection at the same time.
